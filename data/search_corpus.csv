4776,0,Is hemotoxic snake venom safe to ingest?,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,1,I have heard that snake venom is safe to ingest. Normally when I hear about this it is about hemotoxic venoms such as that of a rattlesnake.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,2,The argument towards snake venom being safe to ingest is that snake venom is digested into amino acids.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,3,However no matter the kind of venom there are always going to be side effects from ingesting it.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,4,For hemotoxic venom it is internal bleeding in the peritoneum as well as anemia.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,5,"This is really bad because the person will be in a lot of pain, barely conscious if at all, and have the symptoms of anemia.",<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,6,Rattlesnake venom in particular also causes nausea and vomiting so it can feel like you have a severe stomach infection.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,7,For neurotoxic venom it is the digestive system not working at all or digesting too fast depending on the venom. For myotoxic venom it is muscle injury which can cause muscle soreness.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,8,For cytotoxic venom it is killing of all cells.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,9,However if we had a natural antivenom(like our antibodies reacting to the venom and our wbcs getting rid of it) we could use cytotoxic venom to cure cancer if our cytotoxic T cells aren't active enough.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,10,For cardiotoxic venom it is the heart stopping or beating too fast.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,11,In fact I think that snake venom is more acid resistant than most proteins and so less will be digested. Also the proteins might be too complex for pepsin to break them down.,<digestion><poison><venom>
4776,12,So is hemotoxic snake venom safe to ingest or is it something with a high risk of poisoning if it gets ingested and there are no wounds in the digestive system?,<digestion><poison><venom>

23569,0,Peer-reviewed IFR estimates for (seasonal) influenza?,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,1,It seems every journalist has his favorite expert that they can quote to whip up a CFR or IFR number for influenza.,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,2,"(For example, a question here [which no longer has this information] said that the IFR for influenza is 0.1%, although I think the unclear passages in the sources cited e.g. are actually talking about CFR.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,3,"A Bloomberg piece which is more clear/explicit that it is talking about IFR puts it at 0.04%, but again the source is some expert interviewed.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,4,It seems substantially harder to find some meta-analysis giving such IFR figures for influenza.,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,5,"Most point estimates from studies of outbreak investigations fell in the range 4%–28% with low heterogeneity (I2=0%) with a pooled mean of 16% (95% CI: 13%, 19%).",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,6,"Estimates from the studies conducted across epidemics without adjustment were very heterogeneous (point estimates 0%–100%; I2=97%), while estimates from studies that adjusted for background illnesses were more consistent with point estimates in the range 65%–85% and moderate heterogeneity (I2=58%).",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,7,"Variation in estimates could be partially explained by differences in study design and analysis, and inclusion of mild symptomatic illnesses as asymptomatic in some studies.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,8,So it doesn't look like one can resort to a generally accepted asymptomatic ratio and simply multiply any random CFR from influenza studies with that.,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,9,"Not that the CFR for influenza seems very easy to pin down either, e.g. a meta-analysis on 77 studies on the H1N1/pdm09 CFR found a large range.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,10,"Oddly, this paper's abstract doesn't report the more usual meta-analytic attempts at some central value with confidence intervals.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,11,"We identified very substantial heterogeneity in published estimates, ranging from less than 1 to more than 10,000 deaths per 100,000 cases or infections.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,12,"The choice of case definition in the denominator accounted for substantial heterogeneity, with the higher estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases (point estimates = 0-13,500 per 100,000 cases) compared with symptomatic cases (point estimates = 0-1,200 per 100,000 cases) or infections (point estimates = 1-10 per 100,000 infections).",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,13,Risk based on symptomatic cases increased substantially with age.,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,14,"So yes, they estimated the IFR for H1N1/09 to just 0.001% to 0.01%.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,15,"But supposedly the seasonal influenza, H3N2 in particular, is more deadly than H1N1 (but even that relative proportion might vary with the age group.",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,16,But perhaps there is less disagreement on the CFR for seasonal influenza.,<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,17,"So, are there such IFR (not CFR) estimates for seasonal influenza?",<epidemiology><influenza>
23569,18,"In particular, I'm most interested in global estimates rather than focused on one country and in meta-analytical results rather than single (outbreak/season) studies, but I'll relax my requirements if they are too strict in producing any answer.",<epidemiology><influenza>

17419,0,"7700 Kcal deficit per per kg weight loss, or just 3600 Kcal deficit per kg weight loss?",<weight-loss>
17419,1,Questions about calorie deficit needed for weight loss have been discussed many times here and there plenty of sources pointing out that body fat contains about 7700 Kcal/kg.,<weight-loss>
17419,2,The standard answer is therefore that a deficit of 7700 Kcal is needed to lose 1 kg of body weight in the form of body fat.,<weight-loss>

16195,2,I do see the reasoning behind it but it seems like attempting such thing could go horribly wrong.,<pneumothorax>
16195,3,When i googled about pneumothorax first aid it just says that you should cover the hole (wound) with something that would not allow air to go through while the injured person has his/her chest compressed (breath out).,<pneumothorax>
16195,4,So that when he/she tries to take a breath in the lung will be open by decreased pressure in the chest instead of sucking air through the hole.,<pneumothorax>
16195,5,However the advice i've heard was to go a step further and create an improvised valve that would let air out but not inside.,<pneumothorax>
16195,6,This is achieved by placing some material that does not let air go through over the hole but only fixing the top side of it.,<pneumothorax>
16195,7,So when the pressure inside injured person's chest is lowered this bandage would be pressed onto the hole by the air outside and close it.,<pneumothorax>
16195,8,But when the air/fluid wants to escape through the hole it would go freely.,<pneumothorax>
16195,9,And in case of absolute emergency and lack of better options she said we can use a credit card for it (as a flap). The question is: could it theoretically work?,<pneumothorax>

1058,1,I know a few people who would vomit after or during training (various running exercises).,<exercise><nausea>
1058,2,"My trainer said it was due to the lactate level in the blood, though I can't find a source to corroborate this.",<exercise><nausea>
1058,3,According to the reference from Wikipedia's entry on exercise-induced nausea the duration of exercise and intensity (aerobic vs anaerobic) and prior food or drink consumption are the main factors contributing to this effect.,<exercise><nausea>
1058,4,I gather it is not a very common phenomenon. It seems like a basic reflex to get rid of food so the muscles and/or brain can get more blood.,<exercise><nausea>

1058,9,I can also corroborate this with experiences of many of the people (friends/family) I asked.,<exercise><nausea>
1058,10,The article also states that nausea is a consequence of bloodflow to the stomach/gut being restricted (implying the pH recepter does not directly induce nausea).,<exercise><nausea>
1058,11,So I'm guessing this flow restriction follows from the pH mechanism in the brain?,<exercise><nausea>
1058,12,This theory seems to cover both claims of pH (in the answer below) and food intake (in the wiki article). But it is just conjecture on my part.,<exercise><nausea>

23744,6,Warfarin's effect is more pronounced on PT because factor VII (the first factor in the extrinsic pathway) has the shortest half-life and is therefore the quickest to get depleted.,<medications><laboratory>

25926,1,"I'm aware that some people don't want to take a vaccine for Covid-19, and in fact some countries have suspended rollout of some vaccines due to some young people getting blood clots.",<covid-19><virus>
25926,2,Also some people have had adverse reaction from the virus e.g. anaphylaxis.,<covid-19><virus>

15129,0,Why do testosterone / anabolic steroid injection increase the risk of tendon rupture?,<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,1,"In {1}, a physician mentions that testosterone injections increase the risk of tendon rupture.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,2,"AAS (Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid) abusers, as compared to otherwise similar bodybuilders, showed a markedly increased risk of tendon ruptures, particularly upper body tendon rupture.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,3,The causes of AAS-associated tendon rupture are still incompletely understood. Two alternative (and not mutually exclusive) hypotheses should be considered.,<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,4,"One possibility is that AAS use has little or no deleterious effect on tendons themselves, but merely causes massive hypertrophy of muscles without causing any corresponding strengthening of the associated tendons.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,5,"Thus, the muscle may simply become too strong for its tendon, increasing the possibility of rupture in response to a sudden stress.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,6,"Alternatively, it is possible that high doses of AAS, perhaps in conjunction with intense muscular exercise, may damage the structure of the tendons themselves, making them more vulnerable to rupture even in the absence of excessive stress.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,7,"Evidence favoring the latter hypothesis comes from various animal studies, which have typically found that AAS exposure, usually in conjunction with exercise, led to collagen dysplasia, causing tendons to become stiffer and less flexible, with an increased crimp angle and earlier liability to failure.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,8,"14, 21, 30–32, 34–39, 52 However, one human study using electron microscopy found no evidence of collagen fibril ultrastructural abnormalities in the ruptured tendons of two AAS users as compared to two non-AAS-using controls.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,9,"9 Another recent study found no significant difference in maximal strain and toe limit strain in the patellar tendons of 8 long-term AAS users as compared to 8 experienced weightlifters reporting no AAS use, also arguing against the hypothesis of changes in collagen crimp pattern associated with AAS use.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,10,47 Thus the evidence for a direct toxic effect of AAS on human tendons remains somewhat inconclusive.,<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,11,"Although our study provides no direct evidence on the above issues, it is notable that we found a markedly increased risk of upper body tendon ruptures in AAS users versus non-using weightlifters, whereas the risk of lower body tendon ruptures was only modestly and non-significantly increased among AAS users.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,12,"If indeed AAS use causes damage to human tendon architecture, one might predict that our AAS users, with histories of very extensive exposure to very high doses of AAS, would show a uniformly elevated prevalence of all types of tendon rupture throughout the body, rather than primarily an elevated risk of upper-body tendon ruptures.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,13,"Therefore, our findings might be taken to weigh to at least some degree against a hypothesis of direct tendon damage, and might weigh more in favor of the simple theory that hypertrophied muscles can more easily break their tendons.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,14,"In favor of the latter possibility, it is notable that AAS users are particularly prone to increase upper body musculature, leading to massively hypertrophied pectoralis, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii muscles, while often showing less of an effect on lower body musculature.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>
15129,15,"43 Thus, it is conceivable that muscle hypertrophy alone might account for our findings without postulating an additional mechanism of AAS-induced tendon damage.",<tendinopathy><tendons><testosterone><weightlifting>

31275,4,Most digestion is not idealized so the comparison is at best an attempt at an average normalized to a specific capacity (2000 cal diet).,<nutrition>

31275,11,"Are they generally good approximations, within the significant figures of the displayed data, or are they sometimes very far from average absorption as p varies.",<nutrition>
31275,12,"Though possibly not relevant, USDA literature here documents various conversions between different units, raw and cooked food (p. 11-12), how much of a product is refuse (p. 5), and each appears to be additive.",<nutrition>

24277,4,"The pyrogens inhibit heat-sensing neurons and excite cold-sensing ones, and the altering of these temperature sensors deceives the hypothalamus into thinking the body is cooler than it actually is.",<fever>

24277,6,"The above-normal temperatures are thought to help defend against microbial invasion because they stimulate the motion, activity, and multiplication of white blood cells and increase the production of antibodies.",<fever>

21346,0,The estimated number of COVID-19 infected cases vs the actual number of cases in China stabilizing,<covid-19>
21346,1,The number of cases in China is reportedly stabilizing due to drastic measures taken by its government as the following figure (from [1]) shows.,<covid-19>
21346,2,"On the other hand, based on the value of R0, Marc Lipsitch and other experts argue that 40% - 70% (later lowered to 20% - 60% after R0 was found to be about 2.3) of adults will be infected without effective controls over the next 12-18 months, resulting in 1.5 million deaths in the U.S. based on 1% fatality rate [2-3].",<covid-19>
21346,3,"Given that about 50,000 of new cases were confirmed over the past one and half months, which is about 0.0005% of China's adult population, it seems quite different from the above estimation of 20% - 60% over 12-18 months.",<covid-19>
21346,4,There are two explanations I can come up with,<covid-19>

21346,6,"But asymptomatic cases are rare as quoted below, which weaks the effect of (1).",<covid-19>
21346,7,"People infected with Covid-19 who are truly asymptomatic are rare, Van Kerkhove said. Studies in China estimate that about 1.2% of confirmed cases are asymptomatic.",<covid-19>

25380,1,How do mRNA vaccines work?,<covid-19><medications><virus><vaccination>
25380,2,"To my intuitive understanding, for an mRNA vaccine to work, the mRNAs injected into the patient need to first enter a cell and get translated into proteins.",<covid-19><medications><virus><vaccination>
25380,3,Those proteins must then somehow exit the cell so that they can be seen by T cells. An mRNA vaccine hence appears considerably more complex than a traditional/protein vaccine.,<covid-19><medications><virus><vaccination>

25380,7,I was thinking of potential advantage of such a complex vaccine and thought that maybe it has the advantage of inputting proteins into the bloodstream at a rate (rate that decreases over time with the half-life of the mRNA) while a traditional/protein vaccine makes a single large input of protein into the bloodstream.,<covid-19><medications><virus><vaccination>
25380,8,"I am thinking, that might reduce risks of strong inflammation caused by the vaccine. Would it be true?",<covid-19><medications><virus><vaccination>

16916,9,"With armwrestling, after a single practice, your arms are throbbing; we call it the ""toothache pain"" because it feels just like the stabbing, throbbing pain you get from a bad toothache.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>

16916,11,"On both arms. For about 2 hours. Then it takes about 7 - 10 days to heal and not flare up again, and then you can go back to practice again.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>

16916,21,"Or, if you're going up against someone who's better than you, its a ""negative"" movement: your arm and wrist will fail against them as they pull your arm towards the pad, despite your muscles again working at 100% maximum effort.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>

16916,24,The theory is that this is when your connective tissue (primarily tendons) takes over. Tendons hold muscle to bone.,<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,25,"If a force is being exerted on the bone and the muscle is already at 100%, the force will start being applied moreso to the tendons that are no desperately trying to hold that muscle onto the bone and to not detach.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,26,"This places enormous stress on the tendons, causing them to stretch and tear, just like muscles do when you lift weights at the gym like a normal human being.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,27,"As such the theory is that armwrestling aggravates both muscle and tendons. Since no other sport is really like this, none of us walk into the sport with tendons that are well-conditioned for it.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>

16916,35,) the throbbing comes right back.,<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,36,"My theory is that there might be different types of pain receptors (""nociceptor""?",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,37,") in the tendons and ligaments in your arms that are activated when injuries to your connective tissue occurs, and that perhaps the brain is just trained to interpret these receptors firing as a throbbing pain.",<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>
16916,38,Whatever pain you feel when you get a bad toothache might also be activated by similar receptors.,<muscle><tendons><sports><nociceptor>

16463,0,Digestion and absorption of large scale protein structures,<digestion><proteins><enzyme>
16463,1,In school we learned that all ingested proteins are digested via denaturation and breaking up the larger macro-structure into peptides and amino-acids so small that they can be absorbed and which are then re-used by the body for what ever it needs these basic building blocks.,<digestion><proteins><enzyme>
16463,2,This is supposedly the fate of all larger protein blocks and necessary as only small peptides and amino-acids can enter the blood stream.,<digestion><proteins><enzyme>

26306,0,Are the covid-19 vaccines more protective against severe disease and death than against simple infection?,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,1,"I have frequently heard variations of the following claim: ""The vaccination reduces your chances of getting covid, and even if you do get it, it is much less likely to be severe"".",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,2,"I can't find the source, but I recall a quote of someone saying that, if they tested positive after being vaccinated, they wouldn't be worried because the vaccine would reduce their chances of getting severe disease.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,3,"But, as I read the statistics, they seem to call this claim into question.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,4,"Of course, different vaccines have different efficacies, but in general, the values seem to be in the same ballpark for the merely symptomatic and the severe categories.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,5,I want to make two important points: First all the evidence indicates that the vaccines are very effective against all levels of severity.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,6,The statistics from Michigan below are hugely positive for the vaccine.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,7,"There were less than three hundred cases out of 1.7 million vaccinated people, at a time when you would have expected many thousands if they weren't vaccinated.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,8,Being vaccinated makes the risk low enough that you can basically ignore it for most purposes. This question is about differences in effectiveness for more severe outcomes.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,9,"Second, the efficacy indicates how much the vaccine reduces a risk.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,10,"So, if a vaccine has an efficacy of 95% against both documented infection and death, then it makes the chances of both 20 times smaller than they were, which is great.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,11,The Clalit study in Israel reports 92% efficacy for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against both documented and severe infection.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,12,"There were no deaths in the vaccinated group, but there were so few deaths in the control group that no real conclusions can be drawn.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,13,Another study in Israel found 92% efficacy against documented infection and approximately 97% efficacy against more serious outcomes.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,14,"So, based on this study, the efficacy is almost the same against any symptomatic illness as it is against death.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,15,"More informally, a report from Michigan indicates that there were 246 fully vaccinated residents who got covid, of whom 3 died.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,16,"Both of these numbers are tiny compared to the vaccinated population, but of those rare people who did get sick, more than 1% died, similar to the general pattern.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,17,Also the accepted answer to this question suggests a roughly similar fatality rate for the country as a whole.,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,18,There are somewhat countervailing studies: The original Moderna study had no severe cases in the treatment group (but the number in the control group was only 30).,<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,19,"Different sources report efficacy values for the Janssen/J&J vaccine of 60-75% for infection and values in the 80's for severe infection, a significant difference.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,20,"This study from Qatar is maybe the most supportive of this idea. They find efficacies of 75-90% (depending on the variant) against documented infection, but 97.4% against severe disease.",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,21,"Taking all the data together, can a fully vaccinated person with a symptomatic case of covid be reassured that their chances of death (given that they have a symptomatic case) are much less than if they had not been vaccinated?",<covid-19><vaccination>
26306,22,"For instance, is there a strong argument for supporting the Qatar study over the Israel studies? Or are there reasons for thinking that the statistics on deaths among fully vaccinated people are misleading?",<covid-19><vaccination>

22844,1,Why is the reported case-fatality rate due to COVID-19 much higher in Italy than in China among individuals aged 70 years or older?,<covid-19>
22844,2,A second possible explanation for the high Italian case-fatality rate may be how COVID-19–related deaths are identified in Italy.,<covid-19>

22844,6,"After an initial, extensive testing strategy of both symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of infected patients in a very early phase of the epidemic, on February 25, the Italian Ministry of Health issued more stringent testing policies.",<covid-19>
22844,7,"This recommendation prioritized testing for patients with more severe clinical symptoms who were suspected of having COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Testing was limited for asymptomatic people or those who had limited, mild symptoms.",<covid-19>
22844,8,"This testing strategy resulted in a high proportion of positive results, ie, 19.3% (positive cases, 21,157 of 109,170 tested as of March 14, 2020), and an apparent increase in the case-fatality rate because patients who presented with less severe clinical disease (and therefore with lower fatality rate) were no longer tested (case-fatality rate changed from 3.1% on February 24 to 7.2% on March 17).",<covid-19>

25734,5,"I am not certain that I understand the theory correctly (as I mainly hearing the recommendation rather than the underlying theories), but perhaps the explanation may be that the lack of filaggrin associated with the disease makes the skin vulnerable to various irritants both from the outside and from the inside of the body (such as substances found in foods) thereby introducing food intolerances that are distinct from food allergies (and therefore will not show up in allergy tests) but nonetheless trigger skin flares.",<diet><dermatology><allergy>

20590,1,I understand that human sleep has a cycle of five stages that can repeat itself several times (depends on how long one sleeps),<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>
20590,2,these are named based on the fifth stage occurring about each 90 minutes which is named Rapid Eye Movement sleep (REM sleep).,<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>
20590,3,Likely occurrence of hypnogogig hallucinations such as hallucinating sayings by people close to the person emotionally and socially. This stage will likely include at least one hypnic jerk.,<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>

20590,6,Possibly involving the somewhat rare phenomena of Sleepwalking and bed wetting in children; typically at the end of that stage (This does not include the problems that can happen with certain sleep medications).,<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>
20590,7,"Waking up during REM sleep can be faster in a ""vivid"" fashion due to associative brain areas working (to produce dreaming) and fast communication with primary brain areas.",<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>
20590,8,It is theorized that the general voluntary muscle paralyzation is protective - aimed to prevent or inhibit sharp movements caused per dreaming and keep their sensation as that of associative brain areas (associated with the organs with which one feeling act in a dream) instead the primary ones which would probably cause bruise and bodily harm.,<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>
20590,9,"Notes: As far as I understand, waking up in stage 4 is a ""heavy"" wake up in comparison to the ""vivid"" one described in stage 5.",<sleep><sleep-cycles><sleep-aids>

30532,0,Why does L-DOPA cause hypotension?,<central-nervous-system>
30532,1,L-DOPA is administered in Parkinson's Disease as a prodrug to dopamine which it is converted to in the central nervous system.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,2,"However Dopamine is used as a vasopressor, and L-DOPA is associated with hypotension.",<central-nervous-system>
30532,3,How does this work? I speculate that because L-DOPA conversion peripherally is usually blocked by co-administering a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor that peripheral dopamine levels stay low whilst central levels raise.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,4,Why/how does centrally raised dopamine result in hypotension? Thanks. Possible explanation The dopamine agonist bromocriptine can produce hypotension by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,5,"This causes arterial and venous vasodilation, lowering total peripheral resistance.",<central-nervous-system>
30532,6,The authors of this paper ask whether bromocriptine exerts this effect by agonising dopamine receptors on smooth muscle cells directly or whether this is a suppressing effect of upstream dopamine receptors in the CNS reducing the activity of sympathetic fibres.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,7,I don't know the answer to this but it is intriguing!,<central-nervous-system>
30532,8,"I suspect that directly activating dopamine receptors on smooth muscle cells does not cause vasodilation because dopamine itself is a vasopressor, but I am not sure about this.",<central-nervous-system>
30532,9,How does upstream modulation of the sympathetic nervous system by dopamine work?,<central-nervous-system>
30532,10,This paper discussed how dopamine D2 receptors are present prejunctionally in the SNS and act antagonistically to reduce norepinephrine release from these cells.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,11,Their pharmacological activation causes an inhibition of in vitro and in vivo norepinephrine (NE) release from sympathetic nerve terminals and an inhibition of in vitro epinephrine (E) release from the adrenal medulla.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,12,"Endogenous DA, co-secreted with the other catecholamines (CA), modulates sympathetic-adrenal discharge only during high sympathetic stimulation through an autocrine mechanism, limiting excessive sympathetic adrenal discharge.",<central-nervous-system>
30532,13,Perhaps this explains why L-DOPA produces orthostatic hypotension. Dopamine agonists only exert this modulating effect on the SNS at points of high sympathetic stimulation.,<central-nervous-system>
30532,14,"This may explain why suddenly standing up, which should produce reflex tachycardia and thereby homeostasis of blood pressure fails in some patients causing a BP drop.",<central-nervous-system>

24198,1,I am not a medical professional. I also do not have enough knowledge on medicine or biology.,<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,2,But I have been wondering a lot about one question in particular for some time: How did COVID-19 jump the species barrier?,<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,3,I searched for the topic online and came across this report from WHO published in February 2020.,<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,4,"The new COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats, but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host.",<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,5,"This intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has not yet been identified.",<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,6,"This seems to indicate that the virus first jumped to an intermediate specifies, most likely to a domesticated species before it started affecting humans.",<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,7,"What I am really interested in knowing is does this jump happen naturally and we are just unfortunate that it jumped at this specific time in history or, are there indications that this jump was accompanied by artificial means (i.e., through some artificial means of replicating an animal virus and designing it to be harmful for humans)?",<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,8,I am only curious about this and just wanted some professional opinion.,<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>
24198,9,This question is only for purposes of a healthy and educative discussion and is by no means an attempt to create panic or spread false information and conspiracies. Thank you.,<covid-19><virus><coronavirus>

31326,0,"is there a way to approximate the waveform of PCO2 inside the lungs (alveolar PCO2), from a capnogram signal?",<respiratory-system>
31326,1,I'm doing a project modelling the human lung. This model considers two compartments - the lung and tissue compartments.,<respiratory-system>
31326,2,"In the model, the rate of ventilation is controlled only based on the concentration of CO2 detected by chemoreceptors in the body.",<respiratory-system>
31326,3,The output variables of this model are the partial pressures of carbon dioxide in the lung compartment and the tissue compartment. This model is mostly based on the one given in [1].,<respiratory-system>
31326,4,"Some of the assumptions in this model are that both compartments have homogeneous partial pressures inside them, that at the alveoli the air in the lungs and the arterial blood leaving the lungs are at equilibrium (with respect to CO2 partial pressure), and also that at the tissues- there is equilibrium between co2 in the tissues and the venous blood flow leaving the tissues.",<respiratory-system>
31326,5,"So, according to this model if i had arterial PCO2 and venous PCO2 (real time datasets)- i would get the lung and tissue compartments' PCO2s as well, so i could validate the model.",<respiratory-system>
31326,6,All i have now is the capnogram signal from here [4].,<respiratory-system>
31326,7,"By referring to [2] and [3], i can see that there is a relation between end tidal CO2 (represented in capnogram) and arterial PCO2, as well as between arterial and venous PCO2.",<respiratory-system>
31326,8,"So normally, end tidal PCO2 is 2-5 mmHg lower than arterial PCO2, and the gap between venous and arterial PCO2 is around 6 mmHg (for a certain blood flow rate, CO2 production rate, CO2 dissociation slope).",<respiratory-system>
31326,9,(These differences are between the means of the respective partial pressures).,<respiratory-system>
31326,10,Is there a way to more accurately derive the arterial and venous PCO2 waveforms from the capnogram waveform?,<respiratory-system>
31326,11,"I am asking because i have assumed the amplitudes of these waveforms just based on my model, i'm not sure if this is how it looks in reality. I only know the means have some given seperation.",<respiratory-system>

30597,2,Is the answer something along the lines of: Those that don't die from seasonal flu gradually develop immunity over the course of their lives thus protecting them through middle age.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,3,The effect of the protection gradually succumbing to the cumulative effects of aging.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>

30597,5,"I'm not a health care worker, but am just curious about what is going on here. I'm half expecting the answer to be: It isn't known yet.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,6,"If it is the case though that the mortality risk from COVID-19 has an inverted L shape, with highest rates in older people.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,7,"And if the flu is more like a U shape, with highest mortality seen in the youngest and eldest. Then what reason is there that children aren't hit harder by COVID-19?",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,8,"A quick look at the CDC website (1) suggests that the presumption may still hold, though I note the data table to be published November 22, 2021 so I'm not sure how much influence Omicron is having to those numbers.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,9,However at that time both the hospitalisation rates and Mortality figures display the heavy skewing towards higher numbers older aged patients.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,10,In contrast data from the 2017-2018 flu season (2) shows the distinctive U shape in hospitalisation rates.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,11,I think is a reasonable reference season because it's relativity recent and unlikely to be influenced by COVID effects.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,12,"I do note that child mortality is not exceptionally high, relative to other cohorts, but the high hospitalisation rates at this time suggests to me that is as much to do with the intervention as anything else.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,13,Hence I think it is still valid to ask why the discrepancy with COVID? What is special about this virus and the mechanism of it's effect?,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,14,"Additionally, however, it appears that in the most recent data available on the CDC's COVID NET reveals an uptick in hospitalisations in the under 4 yo cohort in line with a decline in most other age groups (as at Jan 1, 2022).",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,15,"A number of possible factors spring to mind, namely vaccine distributions in the older cohorts, and the relative impact of the omicron variant being different to previous strains.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,16,The recent uptick in the group I had initially thought to be somewhat protected got me thinking about a possible explanation.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,17,Children have (perhaps) subtly different physiology from adults and the traits that made the original corona virus variants deadly were at first optimised for an adult focused transmission route.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,18,"Despite not necessarily being tuned for transmission through the young, over time some virus does evolve to become better adapted to this route, in part because some virus is transmitted this way.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,19,"There are no doubt plenty of ways this could happen (we are talking about at least two complex systems interacting), and no doubt a number of beneficial mutations result in poorer outcomes for host children.",<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,20,Of course this is just a working hypothesis. But I thought I'd share it while I try to look for relevant data on what is actually happening here.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,21,So after a brief look over the wikipedia articles for influenza (3) and COVID-19 (4) it is not a whole lot clearer why there should be a difference in how they affect children.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>
30597,22,At least in the case of influenza it is well known that children who have not been exposed to multiple exposures have weaker immunity and consequently more severe symptoms. This simply ramifies the question in my view.,<covid-19><influenza><pediatrics><symptoms><respiratory-system>

28769,0,How does a cardiopulmonary bypass machine continue circulation without cutting off circulation to the pulmonary veins and artery?,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,1,"So, my first stop in trying to answer this question was on Johns Hopkins website, but they are way too vague about the procedure, especially the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,2,“The surgeon will put tubes into your chest so that your blood can be pumped through your body by a heart-lung (cardiopulmonary bypass) machine while your heart is stopped and replaced”.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,3,"So, I tried several more websites, such as WebMD, the Mayo Clinic, Medline Plus, the University of Rochester Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and a few others, before I altered my search.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,4,"Next, I started looking for information specifically on CPBM.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,5,The first article I came to was from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. We’ll call this exhibit 1. This gave a much better description of how the CPBM works.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,6,"It tells me single-stage cannulae are used during most open-heart surgeries, which involves two cannulae being inserted into the superior and inferior vena cava and joined by a “Y-piece”.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,7,"Now I searched “Y-piece”, “Y-piece heart surgery”, and finally found something when I searched “Y-piece cannula”.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,8,"From what I understand, this is just a triple line IV that feeds into a single catheter, but I can’t be sure, the Wikipedia page is a little vague, I’m going off the picture on the Wiki page.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,9,"Luckily, this is irrelevant.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,10,"This page then says that Dual-stage cannulae are used for most closed-heart procedures. Now, other research tells me that the advantage of single-stage is speed and fewer incisions.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,11,The downside is that single-stage cannot stop ALL blood from pumping to the heart.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,12,"What confused me is that the above website says that two cannulae are used for single-stage, but this website, which we’ll call exhibit 2, says that dual-stage also uses two cannulae.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,13,"Further the sites disagree on how many cannulae are used for dual stage. Exhibit 1 says that 1 cannula is used for dual stage, while the other website says 2.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,14,"Logic would tell me the first website made a typo, but I have no idea what to make of it.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,15,"So, I am not sure what’s up with that, but I am hoping that is irrelevant to my question. But they don't specifically talk about transplant surgery.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,16,"I understand that during heart surgery, (but maybe not heart transplant surgery, unclear as to whether it is sutured in a transplant) the arterial cannula is stitched into the aorta, as this INCREDIBLE video shows.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,17,"Then the venous cannula is inserted into the right atrium, passes through the diaphragm, and into the inferior vena cava just behind the liver, again, as shown in this video.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,18,"Next, the aortic root vent is placed on the ascending aorta, between arterial and venous cannula, in order to push cold potassium into the heart in order to stop it as shown here.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,19,"Then, sometimes another cannula, the coronary sinus catheter, goes through the free wall of the right atrium and is inserted “by feel” (which seems nuts to me) into the coronary sinus, as shown here.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,20,"Now, I believe he answers my question here when he talks about clamping the aorta. He says that will stop the blood from flowing to the heart.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,21,He says the only way out will be down the heart arteries. But I don’t understand how.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,22,"Next, I found this AMAZING video of a computer-animated heart suspended in space undergoing a heart transplant.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,23,Here’s what I have learned. There are several major blood vessels that go to/from the heart that need to be accounted for.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,24,"First there is the aorta, which is the main artery that pumps blood to the rest of the body. A cannula is inserted into the aorta. Then there is the superior and inferior vena cava.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,25,"The superior vena cava carries blood from the head, neck, arms, and chest to the heart, while the inferior vena cava brings blood from the legs, feet, abdomen, and pelvis to the heart.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,26,"Both will receive a cannula. As I understand, next, the aorta is clamped distil to the cannula. Then, cold cardioplegia is pushed through the aortic cannula, stopping the heart from beating for removal.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,27,"Next, cable snares are placed around both parts of the vena cava, distal to the cannulae in order to stop blood flow.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,28,"Following this, the superior and inferior vena cava are severed proximal to the heart, making sure to leave a decent rim of tissue to which the donor heart can be attached.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,29,"Next the ascending aorta is severed proximal to the clamp, followed by the pulmonary artery.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,30,"Then, the left atrium is divided making sure to leave the four pulmonary veins “attached to a cuff of left atrium” where the donor heart can be attached.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,31,At this point the diseased or failing heart is removed.,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,32,"Then, the video says the new heart is “brought into the field and examined for any heart defects”, which I hope was ALSO checked before the other heart was removed.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,33,"I can’t imagine too many surgeons just accept a heart without ever looking at it, then remove a patient’s heart, only to find out the donor heart is no good.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,34,"So I presume this is the last of many checks. Anyways, the left atrium is then sewed together.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,35,"Following that, the ascending aorta is sutured, and the clamp removed, hopefully restoring function to the heart.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,36,"Then, the pulmonary artery, inferior vena cava, then superior vena cava are all sutured to the new heart. Next, the patient is slowly weaned off bypass, and the rest is irrelevant.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,37,"So, my question is, once the heart is removed, why does blood not pour out of the hole left where the left atrium was, and the pulmonary artery? Neither of these are clamped.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,38,"The pulmonary veins all empty into the left atrium. So, how does the CPBM continue circulation when there is a gaping hole where four large veins empty, and an even larger artery? I’m obviously missing something.",<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>
28769,39,It just seems necessary to clamp the pulmonary veins and artery. .,<surgery><cardiology><heart-transplant>

14282,0,How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for tests in mental health?,<statistics><test>
14282,1,Originally the question was How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for the first test available for a disease? but I narrowed it down a bit since it seemed to be too broad.,<statistics><test>
14282,2,Given that measuring Sensitivity and Specificity requires that you know in advance which people are positive or negative for some disease what's the general process if you develop a new test for a new disease where there's no existing test for the disease making it hard to actually reason about who has the disease and who doesn't.,<statistics><test>
14282,3,"Similarily, if you have an existing test and develop a new test that is supposed to be more accurate, how are you going to tell who has the disease and who not because using the existing test to quantify that introduces ""unkown"" errors.",<statistics><test>
14282,4,"Similarily, how is this done for diseases that don't even have biomarkers available at that point. I.e. mental illnesses like depression.",<statistics><test>
14282,5,"The way they are defined is by a set of criteria that define the illness and then people develop questionaires to screen for these mental illnesses but since the only way of knowing whether somebody actually has depression is to apply the criteria from the definition those criteria are actually what defines the test in the sense that hose criteria determine whether somebody has the disease, or not.",<statistics><test>
14282,6,"In essence, doesn't this mean that you invent criteria based upon 'nothing' and then create a questionnaire for it but since the definition is actually arbitrary how does this gain you new insight or new information?",<statistics><test>
14282,7,"In some sense, I could define 'hoarding' as well... 'excessively collecting/hoarding objects...' and then devise a questionaire that consisting of two questions 'do you hoard books' and 'do you hoard empty bottles' and if 80% of hoarders do one of these things I will have 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity but I might as well just use the criteria from the definition and do much better than that questionnaire.",<statistics><test>
14282,8,You can't really make the argument that the criteria are set so that it fits people having the disease well... because the criteria is what defines the disease in the first place contrary to disease that are diagnosed based on an underlying known pathology and tests try to detect that pathology (or side-effects of that pathology) and the accuracy of the test depends on how good in can detect that pathology.,<statistics><test>
14282,9,I guess the way I'd do it is I'd just measure a lot of stuff and then see if I can find any significant correlation.,<statistics><test>
14282,10,"Like I have 100 patients with similar symptoms and I check their blood and see that 80 of those patients have more copper in their blood than a healthy control group causing me to think that copper is involved in the pathology then I'd investigate that further and then I notice that their bodies don't process copper as they should and this sometimes causes in 90% of the people with that pathology increased copper blood levels, in 10% we don't see that and the other 10% of my patients turned out to have something that produces the same symptoms but the pathology is something completely different.",<statistics><test>
14282,11,So I devise a test around that that' measures elevated copper levels which 90% people (with that pathology) have but with some errors and due a cut-off level I have to put somewhere let's say I get about 88% sensitivity and 96% of specificity (because a few people have idiopathic elevated copper levels or something that produces a higher copper level).,<statistics><test>
14282,12,But I obviously can't really do the same for illnesses where I don't know the pathology because there's zero way of telling who has which pathology. Like depression. If I define depression as 'a.,<statistics><test>
14282,13,") has low mood on most of the days for at least 6 months' or similar and this is both the test AND the definition of the disorder I obviously get 100% sensitivity, but that's because the test and the definition is the exact same thing and there's no way of determining the specificity because everything that matches my criteria is by definition having this illness I just defined meaning it will match absolutely everything that provokes these symptoms regardless of the pathology so I can't really measure specificity unless I neglect the existence of other diseases producing the same symptoms, in which case I'd get both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity but this is obviously 'cheating' OR if I just define it as co-morbid to some other pathology in every case but that's basically also just a neat 'cheat'?",<statistics><test>
14282,14,I could then add a little extra criteria 'b.,<statistics><test>
14282,15,") not due to some other disorder' but this at least scientifically looks like another 'cheat' because now you don't have a test for anything anymore to begin with. You have a definition, but no test.",<statistics><test>
